# trim

**trim.py** is a script used to remove (archive in a different folder) audio recording files outside a specified period. This is designed as part of a management and cleaning pipeline for data collected using Autonomous recording units (ARUs). While intended to monitor soundscapes and wildlife sounds, ARUs may record field teams performing installation, recovery, or maintenance. This script is designed to use deployment log data containing the date and time of these activities to remove these recordings. 

By default, `python trim.py folder/` will create 3 destination folders in `folder/` and move files accordingly. 

- `in-period/`: files only containing recordings during the deployment period.
- `out-of-period/`:  files containing recordings outside the deployment period. Typically these are recordings from ARU that were not turned off after pick-up or that happened during ARU deployment/pick-up/swap.
- `not-processed/`: files that the script could not process. Usually, because the audio file contains no metadata and filenames 

This procedure does NOT delete any files. If necessary, the user can decide to delete the `out-of-period` folder after inspection.

## 1. Folder structure

The `trim` assumes audio files are organized in subdirectories and a file named `deployment-sheet.csv` in the parent folder containing columns for deployment and/or pick-up dates and times.

```
└── folder/
  ├── deployment-sheet.csv
  ├── subdir1/
     ├── 20220728_013000.mp3
     └── 20220728_010000.mp3
  └── subdir3/
     ├── 20220607_100000.WAV.mp3
     ├── 20220608_100000.WAV.mp3
     └── 20220609_100000.WAV.mp3
```

The original subdirectory structure is preserved in destination folders. 

The script will use audio file metadata to infer the beginning and end of recordings. If the file contains no metadata or it cannot be loaded, it will try to parse the filename assuming it follows the `yyyymmdd_hhmmss.audio_extension` standard, for example `20220728_013000.WAV`.

## 2. Deployment sheet

For `trim` to work please provide a CSV sheet containing the following columns: 

- `dropoff_date`: Date time of ARU deployment. The default format is `%m/%d/%y %H:%M.`
- `pickup_date`: Date and time for ARU recovery. The default format is `%m/%d/%y %H:%M.`
- `card_code`: Subdirectories names, typically micro-SD card IDs.

**WARNING: Current version only accepts dates in UTC time zone.**

## 3. Usage


```
python trim.py configs/your-config.yaml --dry-run
```

Configuration file should be a .yaml file and follow the format:
```
data_folder: "/path/to/your/data/folder/"

# audio-moth or smm
aru_type: smm 

# filename for deployment sheet in data_folder
deployment_sheet: my_deployment_sheet.csv

# Sheet columns
pickup_time_column: pickup_date
deployment_time_column: dropoff_date
subdirectories_column: recorder_code

# Sheet date format
datetime_format_str : '%m/%d/%y %H:%M'
audio_formats: ['mp3', 'wav','WAV']
gps_formats: ['PPS', 'pps', 'CSV', 'csv']

# Add a delay in hours to deployment time and subtract from pickup time.
delay_hours: null
```


Additional command line arguments:

`--dry-run`: Do not move files, just create _trimming-actions.csv sheet.

`--silent`: Do not print performed actions while running the script.
